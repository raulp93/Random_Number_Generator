# CS-361-Assignment-8
This is a sample of code that will call and receive data from other program functions.

# How to Request Data
1. In the codes, it will include a Request.txt file that will be used to add integers or strings inside the file.
2. The main program will set a string in the code, and it will request for a number, and then it will continue on with program.
3. This txt file will be used in other code files that will be in use of my program. 

# How the Data is Received
In the main program, it will have a code that writes a string that ask to Send a Number, then it will go throught the microservice, and 
return back to the main program with the new data. 
It will do so by reading the txt file and print it out for the user to use, if they want.
